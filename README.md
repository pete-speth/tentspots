# TentSpots

This is my capstone project for the Software Guild bootcamp. It is a website that tracks campsite locations and information and allows users to  to log visits to the campsites.

This repository includes the source code for the application, the SQL scripts for creating and inserting sample data into a mySQL database, and the documentation I created when originally designing the project.
